# Heap(co-authorized with gpt)

## Definition
A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.

## Types
- Min Heap
- Max Heap

## Common Operations
- Insert
- Delete (Extract Min / Max)
- Heapify

## Time Complexity
| Operation | Time |
|---------|------|
| Insert  | O(log n) |
| Delete  | O(log n) |
| Get Min/Max | O(1) |

## Space Complexity
- O(n)

## Applications
- Priority Queue
- Heap Sort
- Scheduling algorithms

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing heap with BST
- Forgetting heap property after insertion
- Incorrect parent/child index calculation
