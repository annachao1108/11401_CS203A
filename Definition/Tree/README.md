# Tree(co-authorized with gpt)

## Definition
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes,
with a single root and multiple subtrees.

## Types
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- Heap

## Tree Traversal
- Inorder
- Preorder
- Postorder
- Level-order

## Time Complexity (BST)
| Operation | Average | Worst |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Search  | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Insert  | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Delete  | O(log n) | O(n) |

## When to Use
- Hierarchical data
- Searching and sorting
- Expression trees

## Common Mistakes
- Confusing traversal orders
- Violating BST properties
- Incorrect recursion base case
