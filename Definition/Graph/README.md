# Graph(co-authorized with gpt)

## Definition
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

## Types
- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Weighted Graph
- Unweighted Graph

## Representation
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

## Traversal Algorithms
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)

## Time Complexity
| Algorithm | Time |
|---------|------|
| BFS | O(V + E) |
| DFS | O(V + E) |

## Applications
- Social networks
- Routing algorithms
- Dependency graphs

## Common Mistakes
- Forgetting visited array
- Confusing directed and undirected edges
- Incorrect graph representation

## Exam Focus
- BFS / DFS order
- Graph representation conversion
